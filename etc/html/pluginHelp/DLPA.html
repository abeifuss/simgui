The Dependent Link Padding Algorithm. An output strategy for channel-based mixes. Provably finds the minimum joint sending rate for a given set of connections and a global maximum message delay bound. Requires clients to send no dummy traffic as the first mix will add dummies. Requires the (final) receiver to be able to receive dummy messages to be "secure" against traffic analysis. Implemented as described in Fig. 3 of the paper on the right, i.e. none-heuristic.
